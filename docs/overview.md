# Overview

This project explores techniques for detecting secrets in source code and repositories. Goals:

- Prototype detectors (regex, entropy, heuristic-based)
- Define a simple rule format and evaluation harness
- Collect metrics on false positives/false negatives
- Document limitations and safe-handling practices
